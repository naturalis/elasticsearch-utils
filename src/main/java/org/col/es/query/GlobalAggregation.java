/**
 * The "global" aggregation is basically a dummy aggregation that resets c.q. bypasses the execution context of the top-level aggregations.
 * Ordinarily, top-level aggregations execute within the context provided by the main query of the search request (i.e. they aggregate over
 * the document set produced by that query). By using the global aggregation as the top-level aggregation, the aggregations directly
 * underneath it will aggregate over all documents in the entire index. This allows us to wrap document retrieval and facet retrieval in
 * one and the same search request.
