 * than at the level of the query itself - which is pretty odd. Unfortunately, Elasticsearch's object model is not very
 * consistent, and the {@link TermsQuery} (not to be confused with the {@link TermQuery}) and the
 * {@link ConstantScoreQuery} are exceptions where the name and boost value <i>are indeed</i> set in the query object
 * itself.
